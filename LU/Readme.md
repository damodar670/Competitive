You are given a sequence a1,a2,…,aN of non-negative integers. Your task is to process Q queries of the following format:
each query is described by two integers L≤R and asks to calculate the number of triples (i,j,k), such that L<i<j<k<R and aL>ai<aj>ak<aR.
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                        
Input :                                                                                                                           
The first line of the input contains two integers N and Q denoting the size of the sequence and the number of the queries to process.
The second line contains N non-negative integers a1,a2,…,aN.
Each of the next Q lines contains two integers L and R describing the corresponding query.                                                                                           
Output: 
For each query, output a single line containing one integers: the number of triples as described above.
