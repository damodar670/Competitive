You are given a sequence a1,a2,…,aN of non-negative integers. Your task is to process Q queries of the following format:
each query is described by two integers L≤R and asks to calculate the number of triples (i,j,k), such that L<i<j<k<R and aL>ai<aj>ak<aR.
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                        
Input :
